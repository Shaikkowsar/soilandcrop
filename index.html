    <h1><b> cultivation techniques </b></h1>
   <p><b> soil type and appropriate cultivation techniques</b></p>
   <p>Decisions about appropriate cultivations are also determined to a large extent by soil types. What may be appropriate for a chalky clay loam could cause major problems on a silt loam soil. The major soil textural classes and the most appropriate cultivation techniques are outlined as follows: </p>
  <center> <img src="farm/2.jpg"height="350px"width="350px"></center>
   <p><b> sandy soils</b></p>
   <p>Ploughing followed by seedbed consolidation with furrow press is preferred. It is beneficial to minimise ground pressure from machinery to reduce compaction. Use deep tines or subsoiling on a regular basis to loosen plough pans and deep compaction. </p>
 <p><b>silty soils </b></p>
 <p>Bed systems for vegetables are useful to prevent widespread compaction. Reduced tillage is not appropriate on light and medium silts but may be possible on heavy silts. It is preferential to use mouldboard ploughing, especially in vegetable growing areas where more than one crop a year is grown and trash must be incorporated quickly. The seedbed should not be too fine otherwise capping is likely. Likewise, subsoiling or deep cultivation is required to break up plough pans and deep compaction caused by ground pressure from machinery. It is advisable to avoid power harrows which destroy soil structure. </p>
 <p><b> clay soils</b></p>
 <p>Cultivations should be kept to a minimum. Reduced tillage is often appropriate, especially where free lime is present, with deeper loosening every 3–4 years and mole draining every 4–7 years to ensure good drainage. Clay makes spring cropping difficult and seedbeds should be achieved with one pass if possible. </p>
 <p><b> Loam soils</b></p>
 <p>Where free lime is present on heavier loams, reduced cultivation is suitable. Whereas, it is less appropriate on sandy and silty loams. . Deep loosening will be required, especially on lighter loams. </p>
 <p><b>peat soils </b></p>
 <p> Avoid excessive cultivations in spring as this can dry out surface layers, leaving soil vulnerable to wind erosion. Deep ploughing shallow peats can incorporate silts or clays from below the peat. This can help to stabilise peat and may reduce acidity.</p>

   <td>Alluvial soils can be found mainly in the northern Indian delta areas. Such soils cover over 35 percent of India’s total land. </td>
   <td>Such soils are rich nutrients, such as phosphoric acid and organic (humus) matter. We are low in both nitrogen and potash, however. Alluvial soils are a blend of clay and (loam) sand. Such soils appear to be more sandy and can drain property faster than many other soils. </td> 
   <td>In these soils under ideal irrigation, tobacco, cotton, rice, wheat, bajra, sorghum (jowar), pea, pigeon pea, chickpea, black gram, green gram, soya, groundnut, mustard, linseed, sesame, barley, jute, maize, all oilseeds, vegetables, and fruits are suitable. </td>

   <td>  Black soils are also known as Cotton or Regur Soil. Such soils are found primarily in the Deccan lava tract that includes the Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat states. Mostly, this type of soils can be found in the Godavari, Krishna, Narmada, and Tapi river valleys. Because of weathering of the lava rocks, black soils form.</td>
   <td>Black soils are rich in aluminum, iron, lime, magnesium and. Their phosphorus, nitrogen, and humus (organic matter) are weak though. Typically during soil formation, this soil gets its black color from various salts or from humus. Black soils contain a significant quantity of clay but are often sandy in the country’s hills. When wet, the black soils become sticky and develop large cracks during the dry season. </td>
   <td>The moisture of the black soil is very strong hence it is excellent for cotton growing. This is also known popularly as black cotton soil. In these soils, however, there are many other crops that can be grown; rice and sugar cane, wheat, jowar, linseed, sunflower, cereal crops, citrus fruits, tomatoes, tobacco, groundnut, any crops and millets of oilseed. </td>

 <td> Owing to the presence of iron oxide these soils are red in color. These are formed due to metamorphic rocks being weathered. These soils are sandy and mildly acidic, and potash-rich. They are however very low in lime, phosphorus, phosphorous, magnesium, organic (humus) matter.</td>

Owing to the high salt content, arid soils are saline in nature and low in nitrogen. They are however abundant in plant oil. Arid soils vary in color from red to gray. </td>
